# Quant Finance UGRI

This is the PDF file and the presentations for the paper written during my undergraduate research internship in collaboration with my research partner Ralph Davies (@R4lph01). Within the paper we look at SDE theory, their modelling capabilities in finance algorithmic trading, and machine learning. This took around 8 weeks to complete so if you any feedback or questions please dont hesitate to get in touch.
